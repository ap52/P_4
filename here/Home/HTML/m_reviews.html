                    <p> The best movie of the year in my opinion, it unironically has everything. No
                        pun intended.
                        Great action scenes, great romance, comedy, drama. A great "family" film. One
                        of those movies that really leave an impact. 5/5! </p>

                    <p> Despite its flaws, it still remains to be one of my favorites.
                        There is some sort of charm that comes with this movie in particular.
                        It is a strong start to an otherwise mixed franchise, all in good fun! 4.7/5 </p>

                    <p> I love Edgar Wright for his creative camera work,
                        and overall excellent writing in his other films. Baby Driver is a decent
                        action movie that was creative enough. I suppose I am more of a fan of
                        Wrights comedy movies and writing. Not saying it was a bad movie, just decent. 4/5</p>

                        frame by frame. but I think the output is worth it. I love the
                        realistic effect stop-motion gives off, and Coraline gives such a
                        creepy mysterious vibe that I love! 5/5 </p>

                        gets the batman character completely right. It is one of those movies
                        that even as an adult, I can still laugh and enjoy the story. 4.8/5! </p>

                    <p>I hate to throw around this word, but this movie is truly
                        a hidden gem! The original language is in French, but even in
                        the english translation the acting is great! The animation is beautiful
                        especially with all the water colors! A great low-key movie, 4.8/5 </p>

                    <p>For a comic book to movie adaptation, this is a great film. Edgar Wright's
                        greatest strength in the camera being almost another person, and apart from the story!
                        Great visuals and actually funny! Comedy can be a hard genre to make a movie in,
                        but this movie delivers! 4.9/5 </p>

                    <p>I think this movie is alright, but i honestly prefer the second movie,
                        (Rodrick Rules), to this one. There were so many moments with second hand
                        embarrassment, and I am aware that is the point, but Grey is such a jerk! 3/5 </p>

                        and it reminds me of that twee era. Not saying it is peak cinema, but it is
                        certainly worth the time to watch! 4/5 </p>

                        are genuine moments that we are meant to take seriously and moments where it is

                        Espcieally if that feeling is intended by the directors and writers. And in the
                        case of this movie, it's intentions are very clear, and its message as well.

                    <p>Spike Jonze is one of those directors you know you are going
                        to get a good film from. His movies all have a consistent style and feel to them
                        and being John Malkovich is no different. It is a bizzare film with an even
                        bizzare concept but Spike Jonze knows how to make it entertaining and palatable. 4.8/5</p>

                    <p>Horror is another one of those genres that can be easy to mess up,
                        but X still delivers a satisfying and terrifying experience regardless. It remains
                        to have a campy feel to it, but that is exactly what fans of this genre
                        adore, especially slashers! 4.8/5 </p>

                    <p>Compared to the original, I'm glad that they went a somewhat different direction regarding
                        the story. For a remake, it still upholds some originality while also honoring the original movie.
                        In comparison, I much preferred the 1977 version, but that doesn't mean this film doesn't hold any
                        weight. It has some pacing issues but the performances were fantastic, as were the visuals. 4/5 </p>

                    <p>The problem with horror in my opinion, is overused and repeated tropes. There are so
                        many carbon copies of the same horror movie over and over again. However, in recent
                        times there have been a splurge of original horror movies. It Follows being one of
                        the first! It has such a unique concept and an interesting and different horror
                        story. There are no jump scares, or cheap tricks, although there are some issues with the overall structure. It is a decent and original horror movie, I can see why so many people like this film! 4/5

                    <p>This movie is the best. Musicals aren't something I personally particularly
                        love. The sudden burst into song or long-drawn-out monologues. It was
                        never really my thing. However, La La Land is a movie in which the songs
                        the story and performances really carry the film. It is a great example of a so-called
                        modern day musical! Everything in my opinion delivers, and it does a great job in
                        building their arcs and also building their romance! 4.9/5!</p>

                    <p>One of the best movies of all time not kidding! I am in LOVE with Jane Austen media,
                        but there is something about Joe Wrights direction and Kira Knightly that fits so
                        perfectly within this genre. It is a great romance movie about pining and misinformation. These
                        actors have great chemistry, and it might be one of my favorite adaptations of Pride and Prejudice.!
                        5/5!!</p>

                    <p>I am a big fan of Charlie Kaufman's writing. Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind, is no exception.
                        It is an interesting love story that's less about falling in love, and more about falling out of it.
                        It's a movie about memories and the impact that relationships have on people. Its dream like tone is consistent
                        thought Joel's "erasing", these dream like sequences can be very wacky at times,but it still remains to be
                        understandable to the audience. It can be genuinely heartbreaking, and it can be considered a great
                        drama in that sense. 5/5! </p>
